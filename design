To translate a file from english to piglatin I'll do the following:
1. open the file from the user
2. read the lines from the file and split the line into a list of words
3. for each of the words check the first letter:
    if it's a vowel append "way" to the word.
    if it's a consonant then get the consonants until there is a vowel then append that to the rear of the word and append "ay" to the end.
    All of these will be appended before and punctuation or symbols detected.
4. Write each word as it's translated to the outfile.
